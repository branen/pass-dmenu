# pass-dmenu - an ergonomic UI for Password Store

pass-dmenu is a `dmenu`-based UI for Password Store that uses predictive ordering and integrations with `xdotool` and `pass-otp` to reduce considerably the number of keystrokes required to use a password.
It is especially effective where sets of related passwords tend to be addressed in sequence.

It has no strict dependencies besides Python 3, dmenu, and Password Store, so it's easy to install.
See INSTALL and docs/MANUAL.md for details.
