pass-dmenu has no strict dependencies besides Python 3, dmenu, and Password
Store, so you can install it by copying.  Its functionality will be enhanced
if xclip, xdotool, and pass-otp are also installed.

The HTML version of the manual looks much better with the following fonts:

Font name          | CTAN package | Debian package
-------------------+--------------+--------------------------
Bitstream Charter  | charter      | texlive-fonts-recommended
Latin Modern Mono  | lm           | fonts-lmodern
